I get that in Spain as leftover bread with tomatoes  I asked for half dozen of churros they charged me for 12.  Ok I get it soft opening. They still cannot get it together.  People were upset due sitting issues. I get it they are new.  I m from Los Angeles and we go to the Bazar often. Jose is always flashing and fake smiling saying hello to people is the show is Los Angeles.  I saw Jose next to me and I said.  You did a great job looks beautiful here. He responded looking at me like a peasant putting his hand in my face like I wanted to ask for an autograph or something lol. He was so rude and acid then I saw him yelling at a chef in front of us at the bar while I was enjoying my calamari mussels and 10 dollar bread lol.  So Jose. Don't be a jerk i don't even get rude attitude from real top chefs.  In LA you are shiny and fake,  be consistent your staff is lovely remember you are a still an immigrant who came to the country and we pay for your bills so be kind to your guest   We  ll be back on Saturday night Only because the food was good and the server was amazing.

The bartender refused to serve these commonly order drinks due to the lack of garnishes, they could of refused the hot Wine because it didn't meet the temperature standards. . FYI a Calimotxo is red wine with coke, in Spain no one adds garnishes and vino con gassosa is just that wine with a Spanish similarity 7up.|"

Half of restaurant was empty but the host asked us wait in tiny 2 seat waiting area. At 7:49, I asked him about our table,host asked "" ur appointment is 7:45, correct??"" I said yes. He looked at me and walked away at 7:50. Finally we got the table at 8:05. Ordered persimmon as appetizer which was horrible. Plaster, whole wheat Chitarra was very poor , roast port served with pea shoots which was burned, pork was very fatty. It took 45 min to serve horrible food, ruined our evening."|"

In the event you are in the region, go and revel in. In the event you are not in the place, rest assured that there is nothing going on here that warrants a 30-minute commute and/or a 120-minute wait for a table. It is great--it is not magic.|"

The Clams Lisboa is particularly good but we've never been disappointed with anything we have ordered there. The wait can be long at peak hours, but I feel it's well worth it.

And she's beautiful without trying, so eye candy is always a plus. Laine was able to suggest 3 excellent beers according to my description of my preferences and brought tastes. Check!At first, I was a little dismayed that the menu had nearly nothing interesting for non-red-meat-eaters until Laine suggested the Barley Risotto. My first thought was,  ""Meh,  not a Barley lover,"" but I don't have adequate words to describe its amazing flavor. Absolutely delicious! This is a recipe I would not think to create and I am delighted that I tried it. HUGE portion that I was thrilled to be able to take and give a homeless person a meal, too! My only complaint is that the music is screaming loud - Friday 5:30pm - and I want to dine in comfort. Recommendation to owners: set dining room area speakers on a separate volume control so you can offer the best of both worlds for your bar and dining patrons. They have an amazing selection of delicious beer that one may never have the pleasure of encountering. And some from the Bronx and Brooklyn! Love supporting local breweries & business! I'll return on a less busy day and time, I'm sure."|"

Carmine’s Italian Restaurant - Times Square|carmines-italian-restaurant-times-square-new-york-5||Jon W.|NwENfEQNWytStutIuzqMaA||||We were flying up to New York to celebrate a birthday, so I called during the week to make a reservation for five people on March 2nd.  Since we were going to a theater matinee that day, I made the reservation for 5:30pm.  On Friday, March 1st, the restaurant called me to confirm our reservation for 5:30pm the next day. On Saturday, we found that one more person would be joining us for our celebration, so I called the restaurant to increase the table to six people. To my shock, they told me that our reservation was recorded for 9:30pm and the person on the phone could, or would, do nothing about it. I asked for a manager and was connected to a very unhelpful woman, even rude, who told me that despite my original call, despite their calling me to confirm our reservation, they now had it recorded for 9:30pm, nothing was available earlier, and they would do nothing for us, leaving us on a Saturday afternoon, looking for a restaurant so we could have our celebration dinner.  The conduct of the people at Carmine's was shameful and disgraceful, with no attempt to resolve a problem caused by their own inefficiency and discourtesy.  We will not be back to this restaurant.|"

The service was quite moderate, and all the plates were for 4 people and charged twice for dinner - no problem here. The waiter was rude, filthy with red sauce, sweated, and seemed angry - but personally, I have no problem with that either. My problem was that the quality of food was not at all Italian, and not at all good. I ordered a chicken with parmesan and penne, and no restaurant can go wrong with that. I added spaghetti for an extra charge. The waiter returned quickly with a huge plate with microwaved food that I could have perfectly eaten in Mc Donald's. I felt sorry that I finally carried home the remainders of the huge plate, but I am not sure if I will keep them in the fridge, because this was by far the poorest cuisine I have ever tried.|"

Being someone who has worked in the restaurant industry for three years, I'm completely aware of the proper etiquette and customer service abilities one should provide a guest with which was the complete opposite of what I received. I attempted to place a large delivery order for a private event therefore I called the day of in advance to confirm the delivery time I'd have to wait. I let the host employee know that I'd call back later in the day to place my order, not ONCE did the host mention to me that deliveries were ending at 7:00pm. When I called back to place my delivery around 7:15pm the same employee finally made me aware that deliveries had just ended and presumed to argue with me and attempted to lie and say he told me earlier in the day in addition to telling me ""I don't know what to tell you deliveries are done"". I requested to speak to a manager who did absolutely NOTHING to help me or compensate me with an issue that was caused on their behalf due to a lack of communication and etiquette from their employee, I'd also like to point out that I was only 15 minutes after deliveries had ended. I would never spend my money at this restaurant again nor would I recommend anyone else to do so. Not only was the private event almost ruined but either employee cared to correct the mistake that was made on their end nor did they show any sympathy for it. I hope that this review causes a manager who cares to reach out to me and resolve this poor experience I've had."|"

I did not heard not even a please.Just for the register... I was drinking there...They put us on very small counter and after five minutes, a hostes called Mr. T (probably a fake name), came and ask again for at least one of our seats... Don't forget...

Although we arrived at 5:45, we were not seated until after 7.  Although the bar was packed 6 deep, as more customers entered, all claiming they had reservations, the hosts kept telling everyone to leave one person up front to wait for the table and everyone else should move to the bar.  It felt like being on a packed rush hour train, or an episode of Candid Camera.  My aunt, who recently had knee surgery, was forced to stand in this crush for almost an hour and a half.  Every time my mother spoke to a host, he rudely claimed that he had never spoken to her.  Once we finally got a table and ordered whatever would come out quickly enough so that we could make it to the show, the food was inedible.  The Ceasar salad was so overdressed that it was a soggy mess, the lasagna tasted sour, and we were so desperate that we were grateful that the meatballs didn't suck.  This was the worst restaurant experience I've ever had.|"

Well, this past week when we ate there, my husband was dripped on for the entire lunch by a ceiling leak. We have no idea what the fluid was, but GROSS!! Management did nothing to compensate this disgusting event. I even sent them an email a few days ago with no response, no apology. Dry-cleaner can't identify the stains on my husband's suede jacket and shirt from the drips. But Carmine's charged us for the meal in full and now I have a large dry-cleaning bill to boot!  Poor form Carmine's! Time for a new place to make our Christmas tradition.|"

I have had much better before food than this restaurant. Additionally, service was really bad. Our first waiter disappeared so some other lady took our order.  Second waiter finally came back to take our order and questioned if we ordered the right thing. Both waiters never came back to ask us if everything was ok. Never going back.|"

Pepe Giallo|pepe-giallo-new-york||J S.|jzI2yS6FINIzNjrHeXE1yg||||Bad first impression, as lasagne was cold and pasta undercooked with inattentive serviceQuick follow up:Since the review was posted prior to leaving the restaurant, the waiter had an opportunity to express his dissatisfaction with the service comment and asked to clarify as management would question it.With further thought he was probably right, service was overall friendly, courteous and possibly the only good part of the restaurant experience- certainly not the food. The inattentive comment referred specifically to the period of time from being served to having someone ask how everything was. We thought it was a little long as it wasn't until reaching the middle of the lasagne to realize it was ice cold at the core. It was then necessary to grab the bus boy to return the food. Perhaps the waiter got distracted or unreasonably occupied by another customer, that does happen. Upon learning that there were food problems he did what he could to rectify the situation.|"

Not anymore. I had read to avoid the pepperoni and supreme slices, so I tried the buffalo and Hawaiian. The buffalo' s chicken was like it wanted to be breaded, but wasn't. And both slices tasted a bit nasty to me. I read other reviews that the sauce was out of this world. I don't know if it was the unique sauce, or the cheese, or just a bad combination, but it just tasted bad to me.  Sadly, I walked past dozens of other pizza shops to get to this one because of the reviews. Maybe you will like it. But I didnt.|"

The pizza was an hour late, cold and the bottom of the pies were burnt black.  Our office is only a 4 blocks away from them so I can't understand why a ONE HOUR delay considering I called the order in an hour earlier than delivery time.

I used to work around the corner but never paid attention to the name, so when I walked in I knew the place immediately. It's a tourist trap and it's good but it's really hard to mess up pizza. Even a bad slice is halfway decent and this is just okay. The sauce is delicious but the slice is more sauce than cheese. That may work in Italy but not here. And it's overpriced - IMO a slice shouldn't cost more than 3 bucks. This is closing in on 4 and so not worth it. There's a place on 8th ave (just below 14th St) that is waaaay better and cheaper.|"

Riko Peruvian Cuisine|riko-peruvian-cuisine-new-york-2||Grace B.|ACrv932BHTgcLz4gKqggHg||||I am a big fan of South American cuisine. To me the Pio Pio has an excellent Peruvian selection, accompany by flavorful sauces and fantastic rotisserie. So when I tried Pio Pio Riko in Chelsea I expected the same quality of food and I was severely disappointed. The chicken was dry to the bone, the amazing green sauce I love so much, Ahi Verde, was white and thick and tasted like paper towel. The beans were watery, very salty, flavorless, and the service, especially delivery, was just awful.I ordered over the phone, in Spanish, since it seems to be easier, and even after I repeated the order twice, I was delivered the wrong thing. Moreover, the delivery boy, Oscar I think his name was, was very inappropriate. Not only was he asking me questions like how much money I make and if I'm married, he smelled of something terrible. My friend, who was accepting the order with me, stated it may have been the smell of marijuana. In any event, this experience did not dampen my love for Peruvian food, but I will definitely stick to the original Pio Pio and stay away from this knock off.|"

After she said - Why u did not ask your cashier when u were paying!? Imagine!!! cause lately u have to ask at register the to-go soy souse, i spend 25 dollars there and trust me guys i use to go there 3 times a week, not anymore. They became too greedy,  and unprofessional. U dont have to tell people to be polite when u at the first place being rude and senseless. i really wanted  to ask for a manager,  but here i am without appetite  and migraine. Thank u Woorijip, for years of good food, u just lost a regular customer over soy souce and rude customer service.|"

Service is horrible!!!. I walked into the restaurant on a weekday around 11am with my two year old in the small/light stroller. A worker approached to me and told me that no stroller is allowed in the restaurant. I understand that it's a small restaurant and gets crowed during lunch hours, but he did not offer to help me to find an alternative to place my stroller, his attitude was basically like, "" you are not welcome, please leave"".This is the most unfriendly place in NYC!"|"

I called to order for a pick upand they told me to call back again after an hour since they are so busy right now.so I said if I call back after an hour, how do I know if my order is going to be processed if you cannot even take my order right now? so can you guys  take my order and I will be there after an hour to pick it up.And they told me that they cannot, then hung up on me!!!Yes, you read it right. They hung up on me.I called again to see if it was a mistake and if they are willing to apologize, but the line was busy.|"

Instead, we were greeted with 3 different Korean men who shouted in one voice to us to get out.  No kindness, no regard for a family and a child, no willingness to lay down the rule and let us deal with packing the stroller or going some place else.  We walked out and I went back in because I've seen owners over time so often and asked to speak to the manager and he was actually just as rude as the people who greeted us. Needless to say, yes their food was always relatively affordable (although not so clean lately I must say), I will not be going there....If you cannot honor family and a child, you are not worth my money.|"

But the food is so awful, you'd do better to spend your money getting things across the street at the H Mart! The people were unhelpful and whatever you do, don't get the bulgogi (the worst thing I think I've ever eaten in my life, I kid you not). Seriously, if you want cheap and fast food, go across to the korean mart and grab side dishes and instant food. We did that and got some food here, threw all of this crap food out it was so bad.|"

But given my experience at Woorijip, I had to take some time from work to write this post. I'm not a disgruntled customer, but I strongly feel that patrons of any restaurant should be aware of how their dishes are prepared and served. Granted, there are bugs in every corner of NYC...no restaurant is absolutely vermin-free--but the one I found in my lunch today was particularly gross. Anyway, I went to Woorijip this afternoon, and picked up some kimchi fried rice, bok choy, some snow pea-looking vegetable with mushrooms, and chicken. Low and behold, as I near the bottom of my bed of rice, I found that little bugger--literally and figuratively.I immediately stopped eating at the sight of it, and knew right then that no mushroom in the world could be hard-shelled or have tiny little legs, unless scientists have begun to splice mushrooms with bugs. Please let me know.After further examination with my chopsticks (meaning, I poked at the damn thing), the bug, brittle and all, split into two. It was then easier to observe that the bug had wings and some terribly looking insides. Mad gross, to say the least.Forewarning: there may be a bug or bugs in your food, courtesy of Woorijip. Apparently, another patron of this lovely place found a staple in their food. So, word to the wise, please sift through your food with chopsticks...if not, you may just get a crunchy treat with wings. Please see the pictures I added, too. Disgustedly yours,Rachel"|"
