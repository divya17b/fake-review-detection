# Evaluating Performance of Semi-Supervised Self Training in Identifying Fake Reviews.

The main objective of this project is to build classifiers using Semi-Supervised learning methods. We will then use this classifier to identify “fake” restaurant reviews posted on Yelp. Yelp is a website which publishes crowd-sourced reviews about local businesses including restaurants. Yelp uses its own proprietary algorithm for filtering “fake” reviews. For the purpose of this project, we would be assuming Yelp classification as pseudo ground truth. Semi-supervised learning is a class of supervised learning tasks and techniques that also make use of unlabeled data for training - typically a small amount of with a large amount of unlabeled data. Supervised learning methods are effective when there are sufficient labeled instances to construct classifiers. Labeled instances are often difficult, expensive, or time consuming to obtain, because they require empirical research. When it comes to restaurant reviews, we have a large supply of unlabeled data. Often semi supervised learning achieves a better accuracy than supervised learning which is only trained on the labeled data.
